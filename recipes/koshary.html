    <h3>Egyptian Koshary Dish</h3>
    <p>Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food. You can find anything from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a</p>
    <p>cart on the side of the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't miss it. Filling and healthy, come see</p>
    <p>Egypt's most famous dish! Instead of French-fried onions, I use my black pepper onion rings on here. I also caramelize</p>
    <p>about 4 large onions in butter and brown sugar for about 45 minutes and have both kinds of onion on there. It really</p>
    <p>makes it over the top, but a little too much to call it the real street food of Egypt, more like the home-style kind. I hope you</p>
    <p>enjoy!</p>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine the chickpeas, vinegar, coriander, cayenne pepper, and cumin in a</p>
        <p>resealable bag or container with a tight-fitting lid. Store in refrigerator while prepping</p>
        <p>remainder of dish, shaking occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the ditalani pasta in the</p>
            <p>boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; drain and set</p>
            <p>aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Combine the rice with enough cold water to cover; allow to soak for 20 minutes.</p>
            <p>Drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Meanwhile, combine the lentils with enough water to cover in a pot; season with salt</p>
            <p>and pepper. Bring the lentils to a boil and cook at a boil until tender, about 30</p>
            <p>minutes. Drain.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; cook and stir the onion and</p>
            <p>garlic in the hot oil until translucent, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the crushed tomatoes,</p>
            <p>season with salt and pepper, reduce heat to medium-low, and maintain at a simmer</p>
            <p>while preparing remainder of dish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Melt the butter in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the rice to the butter, increase</p>
            <p>heat to high, and fry for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour the chicken stock</p>
            <p>over the rice; bring to a boil. Season the rice mixture with salt and pepper, reduce</p>
            <p>heat to low, cover the pot, and cook until rice is tender, and the liquid has been</p>
            <p>absorbed, about 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Mix the rice and lentils together on a large serving platter. Spread the cooked ditalani</p>
            <p>over the rice and lentil mixture. Serve with the marinated chickpeas, the tomato</p>
            <p>sauce, and the French-fried onions as condiments.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
