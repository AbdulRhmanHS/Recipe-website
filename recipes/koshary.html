    <h3>Egyptian Koshary Dish</h3>
    <p>Koshary is pretty much Egypt's staple street food. You can find anything from a 2-story koshary restaurant to a man with a</p>
    <p>cart on the side of the street. It has no meat, but even the biggest of carnivores don't miss it. Filling and healthy, come see</p>
    <p>Egypt's most famous dish! Instead of French-fried onions, I use my black pepper onion rings on here. I also caramelize</p>
    <p>about 4 large onions in butter and brown sugar for about 45 minutes and have both kinds of onion on there. It really</p>
    <p>makes it over the top, but a little too much to call it the real street food of Egypt, more like the home-style kind. I hope you</p>
    <p>enjoy!</p>
